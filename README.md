# Data-Professional-Survey-Dashboard---Power-Bi-Project

# Project Overview
A Power BI dashboard built from a data‑professionals survey using Power Query (for cleaning and transformation), DAX (for measures), and interactive visuals like bar, donut, card, gauge charts plus buttons and slicers for dynamic insights.

# Business Questions

1. What are the average salary benchmarks across job titles and regions?
2. Which satisfaction areas (salary, management, work–life balance) show the highest or lowest scores?
3. Are there specific regions or career paths where entering the data field is perceived as more challenging?
4. How common are data-related job titles among respondents, and how do they correlate with salary and satisfaction?
   
# Approach
 - _Power Query_ – Cleaned and standardized survey data (e.g., handled “Other” job titles, formatted salary and satisfaction scales, resolved missing values).
 - _Data Modeling_ – Created necessary lookup relationships (e.g., job title categories, region breakdown).
 - _DAX Measures_ – Including Average Salary, Satisfaction Scores by category, Respondent Counts, and Difficulty Ratings.
 - _Visualizations_ – Designed interactive dashboards using charts (bar, map, pie), cards/KPIs, and slicers for exploratory analysis.
